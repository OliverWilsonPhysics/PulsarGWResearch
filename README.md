# PulsarGWResearch
Repository for code and data used in my research.
Code:
The Glitch Data Combiner notebook includes resources and instructions for combining data from the JBCA and ATNF catalogs, or really any two catalogs which use J-names or similar designators. 
The GW Model is less organized, but includes all of the code used to generate my data and preliminary plots and histograms.
Data:
The ATNF and JBCA files are the data I pulled from those catalogs, the rest are intermediary/otherwise useful iterations of the combination of those two datasets. The csv named Updated Glitch Data Final is the final iteration with the most information.

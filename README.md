# PulsarGWResearch
Repository for code and data used in my research.
Code:
The Glitch Data Combiner notebook includes resources and instructions for combining data from the JBCA and ATNF catalogs, or really any two catalogs which use J-names or similar designators. 
The GW Model is less organized, but includes all of the code used to generate my data and preliminary plots and histograms.
The Mass Assigner was used to randomly asssign the masses along the Gaussian described in the paper, if run again will assign another random batch of masses.
Data:
The ATNF and JBCA files are the data I pulled from those catalogs, the rest are intermediary/otherwise useful iterations of the combination of those two datasets. The csv named Updated Glitch Data Final is the final iteration with the most information.
